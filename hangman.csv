the pen is mightier than the sword
when in rome, do as the romans
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
no man is an island
fortune favors the bold
harry potter 
i like turtles
tudja hol szeret a c√°pa
better later than never
a picture is worth a thousand words
there is no such thing as a free lunch
the early bird catches the worm
