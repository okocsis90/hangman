The pen is mightier than the sword !
When in rome, do as the romans
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
No man is an island
Fortune favors the bold
Harry potter
I like turtles
Tudja hol szeret a c√°pa
Better later than never
A picture is worth a thousand words
There is no such thing as a free lunch
The early bird catches the worm
